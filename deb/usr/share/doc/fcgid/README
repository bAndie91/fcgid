SETUP FOR NGINX

  CONFIGURE FCGID
  
  Enable executing php, phtml, php3, etc. files with php-cgi
  interpreter.  Last line contains only flags affects all other file
  types. Flag 'x' instructs fcgid to run only files executable bit set
  on, so in this config, php files are not neccessary to be executable.
  Flag 'h' means the process outputs HTTP headers, so fcgid will not
  generate headers on her own. You can define more script types by
  pattern-matching to their name. Fcgid is ready to run any executable
  file it found. To deny running anything, specify certain type next to
  paths in paths.acl, see next step.
  
  /etc/fcgid/handler.ext:
  PHP  \.ph(p|tml?)\d?$  h  /usr/bin/env php-cgi
  hx
  
  Setup paths within cgi running is allowed. Allow running PHP type
  files within /var/www/cgi-bin, and nothing from anywhere else.
  
  /etc/fcgid/paths.acl:
  +/var/www/cgi-bin PHP
  +/var/www/*/cgi-bin PHP
  -/
  
  Setup running user. Fcgid maps owner of CGI file to a system user, CGI
  file will be run in name of that user. Files owned by root will be run
  by nobody, www-data maps to itself, other files will not be run.
  
  /etc/fcgid/user.map:
  root nobody
  www-data *
  * -


  START DAEMON
  
  Listening on /var/run/fcgid.sock, owned by nginx, logging into local3
  facility, number of processes are tuned.
  
  # fcgid --user nginx --facility local3 --preforks 5 --idlers 2 --max 42
